## Practice branch

* Create a new git repository
* Add a file and commit it
* Add another file and commit it (at this point you should have 2 commits)
* Edit the second file and commit it (3 commits)
* Cancel the last commit (2 commits)
* Create a branch called *some_feat* starting at the first commit
* Edit the first file and commit it in the newly created branch
* List the branches (2 branches)
* Go to back to branch *master*
* Delete *some_feat* branch
