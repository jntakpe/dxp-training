## Map - filter - reduce

I have a list of Person, I want to compute the average age of the people older than 35.

* 1st step, mapping : map the list of persons ```List<Person>``` to a list of ages ```List<Integer>```.
* 2nd step, filtering : filter all integers above 35
* 3rd step, reduction : similar to an SQL aggregation
