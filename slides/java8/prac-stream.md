## Stream practice

* Create a list of 4 persons (login, firstName, lastName, age)
* Compute the average age of the people older than 35.
* Collect the login of the people older than 35.

Implement a method that calculates the smallest integer that can be divided by all the integers from 1 to X
* using imperative algorithm
* using functional algorithm (lambdas)
when X = 5 => integer = 60
when X = 10 => integer = 2520
