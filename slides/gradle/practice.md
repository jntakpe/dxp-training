## Practice

* Create a new directory with a *build.gradle* file
* Create a class with a main method that print 'Hello world'
* Run the class using Gradle
* Create a class that implements : 
```java
public interface Practice {
    int smallestInt(int limit);
}
```
* Import JUnit dependency
* Create 2 tests that verify that smallestInt return *60* and *2520* when limit is *5* and *10* then run the tests
* **Optional** : Implement *smallestInt* to find what is the smallest integer that can be divided by all the integers from 1 to X ?
